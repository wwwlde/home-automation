# Home automation

## Disclaimer

Smart homes are changing the way we live, offering more control, comfort, and security. With tools like Home Assistant, you can automate daily tasks, monitor your environment, and keep your home safe and energy-efficient.

In this guide, Iâ€™ll show you how to build a flexible, scalable smart home system using a Raspberry Pi, Home Assistant, a Zigbee dongle, and various sensors. Itâ€™s not the only way to do it, but it works well and can be customized to fit your needs.

You donâ€™t even need a house or apartment to get startedâ€”the goal is to make any space smarter, wherever you are! ðŸ¤£

## Zigbee2MQTT

Zigbee2MQTT is an open-source project that lets Zigbee devices talk to MQTT brokers, making them compatible with Home Assistant and other automation platforms. Compared to Home Assistantâ€™s built-in Zigbee integration, Zigbee2MQTT offers:

 * Wider device compatibility
 * Frequent updates
 * Strong community support

This makes it a more flexible and reliable choice for managing Zigbee devices in your smart home. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ll be using Zigbee2MQTT in our setup!
